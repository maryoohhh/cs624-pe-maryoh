# PE03 - todos

### Problem:

*Note: This is continuation of HOS03*

#### Part 1:

* Add functionality to add items to a list of to-dos
* Create a button and should add the new to-do to the array of to-dos by clicking that button
* App UI should look similar to this

* Log items you are adding to the array in terminal. Output in terminal should look like this

#### Part 2:

* Build a tab bar filter show either all todos, only completed todos, or the incomplete todos
* App UI should look similar to this
